## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)
- A running MySQL database instance.
- An AWS S3 bucket and credentials (optional, for media uploads).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Install all dependencies** for the root, frontend, and backend projects:

    ```bash
    npm run install:all
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.sample`.
    - Fill in the required environment variables, including your database credentials, JWT secret, and AWS keys.

4.  **Set up the database:**
    - Connect to your MySQL instance.
    - Run the SQL script located at `backend/database/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables.

### Running the Application

Start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently with a single command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch:

- Frontend development server on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port, via Vite).
- Backend API server on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Docker (Production-like local run)

Run frontend and backend with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will launch:

- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend on `http://localhost:5000`

Stop containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```

For AWS EC2 deployment steps, see `DEPLOY_EC2_DOCKER.md`.
